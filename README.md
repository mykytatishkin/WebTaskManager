# What Makes Our Tech Stack Stand Out?
We've carefully chosen our technology stack to ensure a seamless development experience across multiple devices. Whether you're working on a Windows 11 PC or a MacBook M1 Pro, we've got you covered.

### Key Technologies:

- .NET 7+: Our foundation is built on the robust .NET framework, ensuring high-performance and reliability.

- ASP.NET: We leverage ASP.NET for creating powerful and dynamic web interfaces that cater to your task management needs.

- EntityFramework: Our application employs EntityFramework, a state-of-the-art ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) tool, for efficient database interaction.
  
- Serilog: We utilize Serilog for advanced logging capabilities, ensuring comprehensive monitoring and analysis of application activities.

- FluentAPI: We use FluentAPI to streamline database operations, making it easier than ever to manage your tasks and data.

- üç™ Cookie Files: Enhancing user experience is crucial to us, and that's why we utilize cookie files to provide a personalized and seamless interaction.

Plus, with our Docker Container integration, macOS users can effortlessly run SQL Server, ensuring cross-platform compatibility without any hassle.

Experience a beautifully designed application that simplifies team task management like never before!
